# AutoLike

A tool to automate the process of liking posts of an instagram feed

# How to use

Run the Gui.py file. Use a username and password to connect to your account. This information isn't sent anywhere, it is only used by the script to login. It is only saved in a .txt file for your convenience. You can either choose to like all posts in your feed, or only from specific users by providing the usernames.
