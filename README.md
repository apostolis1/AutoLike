# AutoLike

A tool to automate the process of liking posts of an instagram feed

# How to use

Run the Gui.py file. Use a username and password to connect to your account. This information isn't sent anywhere, it is only used by the script to login. It is only saved in a .txt file for your convenience. You can either choose to like all posts in your feed, or only from specific users by providing the usernames

# What libraries are used

Mainly selenium (https://www.selenium.dev/) (so if you want to use it you have to download the webdrivers required for your browser version. It was tested with google chrome it worked perfectly) for the web automation part, and tkinter for the GUI
